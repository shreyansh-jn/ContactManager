# ContactManager
Steps to run the API's:
1. Update the connection string from the appsettings.json file located in the Solution=>ContactManager=>appsettings.json.
2. Open package manager console and run the migration command => "update-database".
3. Use postman/swagger for testing the API's by using the default port and correct URL.
4. HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE needs to be used accordingly.
5. Check ssl certificate verification and turn it on/off in case API's don't run.
6. Some API's require query params as the parameters and some require raw data in json format to send the data as request body.
7. I have attached a postman collection in the same email for all the API's endpoints with their sample request bodies. Change the port name in case if it is different.
